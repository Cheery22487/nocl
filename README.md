# nocl
This project was created during my masters program and aims to predict the photodissociation spectrum of Nitrosylchlorid (NOCl). This project was specifically written to solve the case of NOCl and some parts cannont transfered easily to a different molecule (mainly the potential surfaces). But a large part could in theory be applied to any molecule, though the time complexity scales very bad with the amount of atoms n: O(x^n) where x is the chosen amount of basis functions, typically between 20-100.

Documentation etc on progress
